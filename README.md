# Boyer-Moore-Vs-Rabin-Karp
Comparion of the Boyer-Moore and Rabin Karp pattern matching algorithms using both lists and vectors. 

The program runs both the Rabin Karp and Boyer Moore algorithms with varying levels of intensity. This will involve testing them both with increasingly larger targets to search through. Testing is also conducted to determine the ideal varaible type for patern matching.
